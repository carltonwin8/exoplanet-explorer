# Exoplanet Explorer Promise Tutorial

This repository has been forked from the Udacity Javascript Tutorial.
I have added my code solutions to the repository along with the Udacity solutions.
Need to keep this long term show that I have reminder/refresher of how promises work.
The original readme with details of the project code is
[here](README-ori.md).
I am not big fan of this polymer based code that is a little outdated.
The following list the branches and some of the details.
Naturally look at the commit log and source code for more details.
Not that I did not add details for all branches. Some I did not touch.

   show a method of how to run things in series if needed.
